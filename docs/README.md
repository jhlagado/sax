# ZAX Docs Index

This directory is intentionally small. Each document has a single purpose.

## Canonical

- `zax-spec.md`
  - Primary normative language specification for active development.
- `v01-scope-decisions.md`
  - Scope and migration decisions that drive v0.2 work; use this to understand intentional breaking changes and delivery order.

## Supporting Specs

- `zax-op-system-spec.md`
  - Deep specification for `op` matcher, overload, and expansion behavior.
- `zax-cli.md`
  - CLI contract (flags, outputs, and argument handling).
- `assembler-pipeline.md`
  - Implementation architecture and phase breakdown.

## Planning / Process

- `roadmap.md`
  - Execution plan and milestone tracking.
- `zax-ai-team-prompt.md`
  - Internal contributor guidance for AI-assisted implementation workflow.

## Consolidation Policy

- Remove stale status snapshots and one-off audit docs once their information is folded into canonical specs or tests.
- If a document cannot state a unique purpose in one sentence, consolidate it.
